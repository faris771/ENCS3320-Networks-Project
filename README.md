# About this project
This project encompasses several tasks, each with its own focus.
In Part 1, we tackled various questions and implemented specific commands. 
Part 2 revolved around building a basic UDP client-server broadcasting program.
In Part 3, we developed a straightforward web server using socket programming, HTML, and CSS to design the website's front-end.
Python served as the primary programming language for this endeavor.
